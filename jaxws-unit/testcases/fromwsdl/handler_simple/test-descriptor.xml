     Tests that handler specified in config file is used.

     Each handler adds one to the int during request and response,
     so we should receive the original number plus 4 if the
     handlers are working.

     int x = 1;
     int diff = 4; // 2 per handler invoked
     assertEquals(x+diff,helloPort.hello(x));
