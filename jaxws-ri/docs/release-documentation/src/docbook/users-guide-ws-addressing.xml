        <para>WS Addressing 1.0- Metadata defines standard ways to describe
        message addressing properties like Action, Destination in wsdl and
        also indicate the use of Addressing in wsdl. WS-Addressing Metadata

        candidate recommendation earlier. If you are still using wsdls
        conforming to WS Addressing 1.0 - WSDL Binding specification, skip to
        the next section. Still you may want to update your wsdls to use in
        standard ways defined by the W3C recommended Addressing 1.0 - Metadata
        specification for better interoperability. Also,  There is no standard
        mechanism to describe Member Submission version support in the WSDL
        and some implementaions have used WS-Policy to indicate the support of
        member submission version and &jax-ws.product.name.short; understands
        such assertion.</para>

            <para>In certain cases, the endpoint can lay some restrictions to

            In this case, the response endpoint in the request messages will
            have to use something other than the anonymous URI as the value of
            address. This is typically used when the response needs to be sent
            to a third entity other than the client and service and the
            response is sent to the non-anonyous URI through a new connection

            <para>can be used to indicate that the subject requires
            WS-Addressing and requires the use of anonymous responses. In this
            case, the endpoint requires request messages to use response

            ("<literal>http://www.w3.org/2005/08/addressing/anonymous</literal>")

            that can be used to indicate that an endpoint conforms to the
            WS-Addressing specification. &jax-ws.product.name.short; generates
            this extension element in the WSDL if W3C WS-Addressing is enabled
            on the server-side. On the client side, the RI recognizes this
            extension element and enforce the rules defined by the W3C
            specification. This extensibility element may be augmented with
            <literal>wsdl:required</literal> attribute to indicate whether
            WS-Addressing is required (true) or not (false).</para>

            <para>W3C WS-Addressing WSDL Binding defines
            <literal>wsaw:Anonymous</literal> element which when used in

            assertions regarding a requirement or a constraint in the use of
            anonymous URI in EPRs sent to the endpoint. The WSDL Binding
            defines three distinct values: <literal>optional</literal>,
            <literal>required</literal> and <literal>prohibited</literal> to
            express the assertion. The default value of
            <literal>wsaw:Anonymous</literal> (equivalent to not present) is
            <literal>optional</literal>. An operation with
            <literal>required</literal> <literal>wsaw:Anonymous</literal>

            <para>In this case, a message received at the endpoint, for this
            operation, with a non-anonymous ReplyTo or FaultTo EPR will result
            in a fault message returned back to the client with
            <literal>wsa:OnlyAnonymousAddressSupported</literal> fault code.

            <para>Each method is a variation of an already existing method in
            JAX-WS 2.0. The only addition is an extra var-arg
            <literal>javax.xml.ws.WebServiceFeature</literal> parameter. A
            <literal>WebServiceFeature</literal> is a new class introduced in
            JAX-WS 2.1 specification used to represent a feature that can be
            enabled or disabled for a Web service.</para>

            <para>The JAX-WS 2.1 specification defines
            <literal>javax.xml.ws.soap.AddressingFeature</literal> to enable
            W3C WS-Addressing on the client side. In addition, the
            &jax-ws.product.name.short; also defines
            <literal>com.sun.xml.ws.developer.MemberSubmissionAddressingFeature</literal>
            to enable Member Submission WS-Addressing on the client
            side.</para>

            <para>For example in <literal>fromjava-wsaddressing</literal>
            example, in order to enable W3C WS-Addressing on a proxy,
            <command>wsimport</command> is used to generate the
            <literal>AddNumbersImplService</literal> class. Then a port can be
            obtained using the <literal>getAddNumbersImplPort</literal> method
            and passing an instance of
            <literal>javax.xml.ws.AddressingFeature</literal>. The code looks

            <para>Similarly, a <literal>Dispatch</literal> instance with

        Service.Mode.MESSAGE,
        new com.sun.xml.ws.developer.MemberSubmissionAddressingFeature());]]></programlisting>

            <para>Both <literal>javax.xml.ws.soap.AddressingFeature</literal>
            and
            <literal>com.sun.xml.ws.developer.MemberSubmissionAddressingFeature</literal>
            take two optional Boolean parameters, <literal>enabled</literal>
            (default true) and <literal>required</literal> (default false). If
            enabled, all WS-Addressing headers are generated for an outbound
            message. If <literal>required</literal> is specified true, then
            WS-Addressing rules are enforced for inbound message. Otherwise
            the inbound message is inspected to find out if WS-A is engaged
            and then the rules are enforced.</para>

            <para>For example, to enforce Member Submission WS-Addressing
            rules on the client side, the above code sample will change
            to:</para>

            <informalexample>
                <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[new AddNumbersImplService().getAddNumbersImplPort(new com.sun.xml

        <section xml:id="explicit-disabling">

            <para>A client may like to instruct &jax-ws.product.name.short; to
            disable WS-Addressing processing. The assumption is that in this
            case the client has it's own WS-Addressing processing module. For
            example, a Dispatch-based client in MESSAGE mode may be used to
            perform non-anonymous ReplyTo/FaultTo processing.</para>

            <para>WS-Addressing processing can be explicitly disabled using
            one of new methods added to JAX-WS 2.1 specification as defined in
            Section 3.2. For example, W3C WS-Addressing processing can be
            disabled using the following code:</para>

            <para><informalexample>

        <title>When is WS-Addressing engaged?</title>

        <para>W3C WS-Addressing SOAP Binding <link
        xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-ws-addr-soap-20060509/#conformance">defines</link>
        that if a receiver processes a message containing a
        <literal>wsa:Action</literal> header, then SOAP Binding is engaged,
        and the rules of the specification are enforced. In
        &jax-ws.product.name.short;, if WS-Addressing is explicitly disabled
        then the RI does not follow the rules of engagement. However if
        WS-Addressing is either implicitly or explicitly enabled then
        &jax-ws.product.name.short; engages WS-Addressing based upon the
        presence of <literal>wsa:Action</literal> header.
        &jax-ws.product.name.short; follows same rule for Member Submission
        version as well.</para>

        <para>In effect, if an endpoint advertises WS-Addressing is required
        in the WSDL and a client does not send any WS-Addressing header then
        no WS-Addressing fault is returned back to the client. However if the
        client send <literal>wsa:Action</literal> header then the endpoint
        will enforce all the rules of the specification. For example, if the
        <literal>wsa:MessageID</literal> header is missing for a
        request/response MEP then a fault with appropriate code and sub-code
        is thrown back to the client.</para>
