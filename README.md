# JAX-WS

JAX-WS RI 2.3.0  is a Web Services framework that provides tools and infrastructure to develop Web Services solutions for the end users and middleware developers.

With JAX-WS RI 2.3.0, clients and web services have a big advantage: the platform independence of the Java programming language.
