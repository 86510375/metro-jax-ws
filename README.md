### Licensing and Governance

JAXWS is licensed under a dual license - CDDL 1.1 and GPL 2.0 with Class-path Exception. 
That means you can choose which one of the two suits your needs better and use it under those terms.

Please see the GlassFish contribution guidelines "[How to Contribute](https://javaee.github.io/glassfish/how-to-contribute)", 
which means we can only accept contributions under the
