### Licensing and Governance

JAX-WS is licensed under a dual license - CDDL 1.1 and GPL 2.0 with Class-path Exception. 
That means you can choose which one of the two suits your needs better and use it under those terms.

We use [GlassFish Governance Policy](https://javaee.github.io/metro-jax-ws/CONTRIBUTING)</a>, 
which means we can only accept contributions under the 
terms of [OCA](http://oracle.com/technetwork/goto/oca).
